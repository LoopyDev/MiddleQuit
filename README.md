# MiddleQuit

Quit apps by middle clicking Dock items. 

# Help me out - I'm not greedy :)
Build the app yourself, or get it here: https://loopydev.gumroad.com/l/rmmvgk
(and buy me a fraction of a coffee for my efforts ☺️)

# Features
- Regular Quit, Force Quit, or both.
- Easy 'Launch at Login' setting
- Hide icon from Menu Bar
- Modifier keys assignable in app settings

## Info
The app lives in the top bar, from where you can enable launch at login, open the accessibility settings (if not enabled - more on that below), open settings, or quit the app.

If the stock icon in the top bar bothers you, let me know and I'll bother to make an icon for it. I'm working under the assumption that people will hide it from the top bar. 

## Installation
When you first open the app, it will ask you to enable Accessibility permissions. This is standard for apps like these, so they can interfere with regular input processes. After enabling, quit and restart the app.

If you choose to download and run the pre-built app, when initially opening it, you will need to manually allow it to run (Apple could not verify “MiddleQuit.app” is free of malware that may harm your Mac or compromise your privacy.) by going to System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Scroll down to 'Security' and allow it there. 

I'm not completely familiar with sharing macOS apps, so if you have any issues installing, open an issue and hopefully we can work through it together. 

## Compatibility
**Tahoe 26.1**
**Sequoia 15.6.1**

**Currently reported not working on Sonoma** (but I am working on it)

(let me know your system and if it works on it, I can add to this list)

## Don't trust me?
I don't blame you! I'm just a random guy on the internet who vibe coded a Mac app. If you prefer, build the app yourself in Xcode after ensuring there is no pesky code inside. 😄
